Here a small list of what's expected your project to include:

- A postgres database hosted in Elephantsql
- Use Prisma.js as ORM to interact with the db
- Backend built with Node.js and Express
- Frontend with React.js
- Frontend State management with Zustand
- HTML Semantics across your frontend
- Typescript across the backend and frontend
- Minimal test coverage

# regarding the .env file:
# you need to register into "https://developer.tomtom.com/" and save your personal-key into a variable called:
TOMTOM=""
# this way we will be able to use it from `process.env.TOMTOM`
